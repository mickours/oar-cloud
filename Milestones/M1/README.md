oar-cloud Milestone 1
====================

This is the goal of the the first Milestone M1:

In an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS environment :

#install and configure OAR
#install and configure LXC
#make OAR reservation
#launch one or more VM using LXC
#Connect to the VM
#script this!

The cigri devel appliance was used as an configuration example for this.
The Ubuntu 12.04 LTS distribution has been choosen because it seems to be one of
the few distributions where LXC works out-of-the-box.
